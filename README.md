# Nano GICP Localization

A lightweight, fast LIDAR/pointcloud localization package designed to provide `/map` to `/odom` transformation. This implementation leverages the header-only `nano_gicp` library for efficient point cloud registration and is inspired by Direct LIDAR Odometry (DLO).

## Overview

Nano GICP Localization provides a streamlined solution for robot localization using point cloud data. The focus is on simplicity, speed, and minimal dependencies, making it ideal for resource-constrained systems.
